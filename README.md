#### Folders:
- cw1: Coursework 1 graded at 90%. Implementation of QR factorisation by Householder Reflections, polynomial fitting by least squares followed by QR Analysis of a dataset.
- cw2: Coursework 2 graded at 97%. Investigation of conditioning and stability of QR by Householder Reflections as well as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Implementation of LU decomposition for sparse banded matrices. Introduction to Exponential Integrators: Implementation of REXI for the wave equation, verifying the method with explicit second-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping.
- cw3: Coursework 3 graded at 72%. Part 1: Implementation of the QR algorithm, pure and with shifts for eigenvalue computation. Part 2: Implementation of GMRES with and without preconditioning for solving a PDE system. Part 3: Applications of the GMRES methods explored in part 2 to image denoising as well as comparison with a different iterative method described in the coursework question 3.3.
- cw4_mastery: Coursework 4 (Mastery) graded at 65%. Implementation of exponential integration methods for banded matrices arising from the finite difference representation of the heat equation using Arnoldi Iteration as described in the paper Gallopoulos and Saad (1992). Verification of the method using Runge-Kutta time-stepping integration.
